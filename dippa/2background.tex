\section{Limited Liability Housing Company}

In this chapter the regime of limited liability housing company is presented and the operation of it is described in order to provide background information. First the basic concept is explained, then the responsibilities and operation of the limited liability housing company is presented.

Limited liability housing company is a type of limited liability company whose purpose is to own and control one or multiple building or a part of it where over the half of the combined floor surface area of the apartment or apartments is designated in the articles of association to be possessed by the shareholders and to be used as residential apartments \parencite{LLHA:2}. To put it simple, the company owns the property and the share capital is divided into shares. For the shareholders, these shares then give a right of possession to a specific apartment. \parencite{Lujanen:2017}. So, when a person buys an apartment in a limited liability housing company, she become the shareholder of the bought apartment \parencite{YIT}.

In Finland about 2,7 million people are living in approximately 88 000 limited liability housing companies \parencite{REMF, Stats}. This limited liability housing company regime is an unique setting compared to other countries and it is dominant form of ownership in multi-apartment buildings in Finland \parencite{Lujanen:2017}. The operation of the limited liability company is regulated in the Finnish law and the articles of association contains the internal law and order of the specific housing company \parencite{YIT}. In practice, the limited liability housing company takes care of the real estates and buildings to which it controls \parencite{LLHA:2}. 

\subsection{The Division of Responsibilities}

Limited liability housing company is led by the board and deputy landlord and their job is to act in a way that advances the company's interest \parencite{LLHA:2}. However, this does not mean that the people who are in the board should have expertise in the real estate field. So, the people working in the board are mostly laypersons which should be considered inside the board as well as among the shareholders. \parencite{Hallintotapa:2017}

The highest decision-making body is the shareholder's meeting which is held once a year. In a shareholder's meeting every shareholder has a right to vote. Shareholders one of the most important responsibility is to decide who will be in the board of the limited liability housing company. The Table~\ref{table:responsibilities} presents the actors who form the limited liability housing company and their responsibilities in addition to the previously mentioned. \parencite{RantanenViiala:2015}

The shareholder's meeting is a place where the shareholders, board members and the deputy landlord meet each other and the meeting provides a good place for discussions and questions \parencite{Hallintotapa:2017}. The decision making in a shareholder's meeting happens usually with the majority decision, which means that the suggestion which has over half of the votes is the final decision. If the voting is related to person, the one who receives most of the votes gets elected. In tie situation the chairperson makes the decision, if the voting is not related to electing a person. \parencite{RantanenViiala:2015}

In the shareholder's meeting the housing board's responsibility is to present the scope of the maintenance actions to be done in the limited liability housing company. This scope is then decided in the meeting. \parencite{RantanenViiala:2015} Based on the \textcite{LLHA:2} the board requires shareholder's meeting's decision to proceed with actions which are considering the size and operation of the company unusual or far-reaching, affecting essentially to the use of the shareholder's apartment or affecting essentially to the obligation to pay maintenance fee or to other expenses which are caused by the use of the shareholder's possessed apartment.

The role of the deputy landlord is similar to the managing director in a limited liability company since it is the deputy landlord's responsibility to take care of the daily administration.  Additionally, deputy landlord puts in action the decisions made by the housing board and takes care that the accounting is done properly according to the law. \parencite{Sarekoski:2015}

\section{Energy Industry in Finland}

This chapter focuses on the energy industry and the ecosystem of it in Finland, but gives also an overview of the international energy transition.

In Finland there are around 100 district heating companies which are responsible for heat distribution, sale and production. Most of these companies are owned by the municipalities. \parencite{Energyindustry:2019,Poyry:2018} Based on the statistics made by \textcite{Energyindustrygraphs:2018} 46 \% of apartment buildings are part of the district heating network which means that 2,92 million residents are living in apartments which are heated with district heating.

\subsection{Energy Transition}

\emph{International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA} published report which discusses the energy transformation and actions needed to do in order to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degree Celsius by the year 2050. This transformation or to speak \emph{energy transition} in practice means going from energy  system that is based on fossil fuels to one which is more efficient and based on renewable energy.

The report states many problems which are not in track with the targets. However, in this thesis the researcher highlights only some of them which are more relevant regarding the thesis focus and scope. Such topic is energy efficiency. One of the facts stated in the report is that the main factors making energy transition to happen are energy efficiency and renewable energy. Together they could deliver 90\% of the required cut in energy-related CO2 emissions in the speed which is needed.

According to IRENA especially in the building sector the energy efficiency becomes more crucial factor in energy transition.  


\section{Customer Centricity}

\textcite{Drucker:2007} states in his book The Practice of Management that the purpose of a business is to create customers by business actions. Moreover the customers are the ones who determines what a business is. For the business, it is most important to understand what the customers consider as value since it is them who decides what the business produces. In addition, according to \textcite{Parniangtong:2017} organizations' performance have also been explained with the focus on the outcomes which the customers value and are willing to pay. This means, that the customers are more satisfied and thus give a competitive advantage for the company. For a company to succeed in nowadays competition in the marketplace, customer centricity is a must \parencite{PathToCustomerCentricity:2006}.

Customer-centric thinking is built on four main arguments which are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Loyal customers should produce more money for a company.
\item New customers might not produce money immediately, but they should be profitable for the company in the future.
\item  It is more affordable to serve and introduce new offerings to long-term customers than to new customers.
\item  Long-term customers are more stable when it comes to pricing and a company's digressions, in addition they are more likely to spread word about the company. \parencite{Parniangtong:2017}
\end{enumerate}

Based on these arguments, the loyal customers bring more value to the company and through this, the competitive advantage of the company becomes better. Because customer-centric thinking drives from the goal where the customer equity is on high level, the company should focus on the customer relationship over lifetime. In order to achieve customer equity the company should know their customers, respond to their needs, appreciate them and maintain a profitable relationship with them over a long time. \parencite{Parniangtong:2017}

\textcite{Parniangtong:2017} states that customer value is created by a value chain which is customer driven, being closer with the customer, selling solution, having trust from the customers and offering intimacy with their customers through personalized experience. Having a customer-driven value chain compared to the traditional product oriented, the company can serve customers' needs better because then the customer needs will drive the changed. This is different from the product oriented value chain where the customers' priorities are seen only at the end of the value chain and the company's mindset is revolving around how they can make more where they are good are. If the customers and their needs and priorities are in the center of attention, the company is more likely to produce products which will differentiate. \parencite{Parniangtong:2017}

The differencies between product centricity and customer centricity is also discussed in the article wrote by \textcite{PathToCustomerCentricity:2006} where the comparison is made through the basic philosophy, business orientation, product positioning, organizational structure and focus, performance metrics, management criteria, selling approach and customer knowledge. The comparison is presented in the Figure~\ref{fig:productvscustomer}.

Being closer with the client means that the company have customized their offerings to individual customers. This is reported to happen for example by collecting information about their customers in order to understand buying patterns and through this the company has been able to influence the future purchase. To do so, the company also needs to view the problems from the perspective of the client and not through their own products. When company does this, they focus on satisfying customer needs and solving their problems and thus it can be said that they sell solutions. \parencite{Parniangtong:2017}

The value of trust and intimacy go hand in hand. A company must gain trust from the customers in order to maintain the relationship. When trust is earned, the goal is to create value through customer intimacy because companies want that making business with them is easy. To do so, company must show to the customer that they care about them, value their business and are aware of their needs as individual and unique customers. \parencite{Parniangtong:2017}

To gain the long-term profits from a customer-centric view, the company need to succeed in the following areas: customer acquisition, customer retention and customer development. Customer acquisition aims to get highly committed customers to be as advocates for the company by helping to look for new customers, increase the amount referrals and understand the cost as well as the value of new customer acquisition. The goal of customer retention is to lengthen the relationships between the company and the best customers as well as to lower the cost of maintaining such relationships. Lastly, customer development strives to develop customers in the direction where they would buy more products or services from the company. \parencite{Fader:2012}

\subsection{Customer Journey Maps}

Based on \textcite{Kalbach:2016} operational efficiency of a company is thought as more important than their customer 
satisfaction. To turn this situation around, alignment diagrams can be used to help organizations to think how their business fit to the lives of customers. Alignment diagrams present the interactions between a customer and an organization in a storytelling way. Additionally, the diagrams offer a way to show both sides of value creation since they help organizations to visualize the strategy as well as they help to design experiences. \parencite{Kalbach:2016}

Alignment diagrams are beneficial because they build empathy, provide a big picture, break silos in organizations, help focusing and point where improvements and innovations can be made. Understanding better people's thoughts and feelings through alignment diagrams build empathy which allows an organization to learn about their customers and real-world human conditions. With the alignment diagrams it is possible to share the understanding and provide a big picture in organizations because the actions become more consistent and the decision making is influenced by the diagrams. \parencite{Kalbach:2016}

Because the alignment diagrams allows to map the customer experiences across different organization departments, it is possible to break down silos. In addition they help organizations to focus because alignment diagrams match the outward-facing activities with inward-facing activities. Lastly, the alignment diagrams reveal opportunities for improvements and growth because the presentation of the information allows it to be understood without middlemen. \parencite{Kalbach:2016}

According to \textcite{Kalbach:2016} the value in mapping experiences becomes from the fact that it allows to discover innovative ways to make interactions better. Moreover, the whole design of the system is then easier to make coherent.

Customer journey maps CJMs are type of alignment diagrams and \textcite{Kalbach:2016} defines customer journey maps to be visualizations about a customer's experiences and usually they illustrate how customers make a choice for example a decision to buy a service. So, customer journey maps present the steps the customers take while engaging with the company through different touchpoints \parencite{Richardson:2010}.

More precisely, CJM's present the interactions in a chronological way including for example customer's actions, thoughts, feelings and pain points. From the organizational view point the CJM's present the roles and departments who are part of creating the experience for the customer. \parencite{Kalbach:2016}

Nowadays, multi-channel shopping has become a standard in the consumer decision-making process because of mobile technologies and social media.
